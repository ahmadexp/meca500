Figure out if it is okay to have the "time out" test passing. 

It is easy to make SendMessage throw whatever exception it gets from a fake socket, but that does not mean
the real socket error will be correct. So how to ensure that? Maybe create an external .txt, .json, etc. 
that contains all of the native error codes for the program and query that?

Also, read chapter 7 of GOOS
